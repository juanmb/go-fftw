These bindings are incomplete, but should include enough functionality that you
can do whatever transforms you need (perhaps not as easily as you would like,
for now).  The function definitions do not mirror exactly what is written in
the docs.  For example, passing arrays does not require passing the size of the
arrays, and there is no need to garbage collect plans.

Usage:
Here is an example of doing a simple DFT with these bindings

    data := fftw.Alloc1d(64)  // Similar to calling make([]complex128, 64)
    forward  := fftw.PlanDft1d(data, data, fftw.Forward, fftw.Estimate)
    backward := fftw.PlanDft1d(data, data, fftw.Backward, fftw.Estimate)
    // ... fill in data with something interesting
    forward.Execute()  // Transforms data, in place, to frequency domain
    // ... do something interesting with data
    backward.Execute()  // Returns data, in place, to time domain

Calling fftw.Alloc1d(64) allows FFTW to allocate the memory so that it is
properly aligned to take advantage of SIMDs.  You could just use
make([]complex128, size) if you want.

Installation:
When installing fftw you must compile it as a shared library:

    ./configure --enable-shared
    make
    make install

Once installed properly, these bindings can be installed like so:

    go get github.com/runningwild/go-fftw
